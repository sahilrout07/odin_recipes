    <h2>Description-:-</h2>
    <p>Kadai Paneer is a vibrant, tangy, deeply spiced paneer recipe that is perfect for enjoying all year round. Made with pantry staples like onions, tomatoes, capsicum (green bell peppers) and Indian spices, this bright dish comes together in 30 minutes. I share two ways to make this curry a semi dry restaurant style version and a spicy home style gravy.</p>
    <p>As the name suggests, Kadai Paneer is a recipe using Indian style cottage cheese a.k.a Paneer which is a soft cheese that does not melt.
        Paneer is a fresh cheese made by curdling milk with lemon juice or vinegar. Unlike American style cottage cheese that is loose and has individual curds, paneer is firm (like tofu), non-melting and can be easily cut into cubes.
        Due to its texture, paneer makes an excellent addition in many Indian curry recipes like Paneer Butter Masala, Palak Paneer, Shahi Paneer and Matar Paneer.
        The word kadai refers to a humble piece of Indian cookware; a kadai is similar to a Chinese wok, but with steeper sides and more depth. This entire dish is made in the kadai, and thus the dish is named “Kadai Paneer” or “Karahi Paneer”.
